# Instructions to execute
- Enter the machine code (hex or binary, numpy works it out) into input.txt (file attached)
- Run. Python 3.10.4 64-bit
- The assembly code will be displayed in stdout as well as stored into output.txt (file attached)
- numpy does not automatically recognise hex and binary numbers. Prefix with 0x and 0b respectively.
- The file paths are relative, so the source code and the IO files must be in the same directory.
